# Hi, I'm Seth

Cybersecurity professional with ~10 years of experience across IT engineering, vulnerability management, threat intelligence, threat detection and incident response. 

In my free time, I hunt for zero-day software vulnerabilities and participate in bug bounty programs. 

I was a GrrCON 2025 main stage speaker on independent vulnerability research, presenting on how I discovered my first CVE.
